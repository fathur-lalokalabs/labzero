## Installation

https://pypa.github.io/pipx/

## Why?

pipx is used to install python packages as standalone application. We use this to install tooling packages that doesn't has to be tied to specific project.

Example packages that we install using pipx:-

- cookiecutter
- black
- flake8
- pytest (for labzero however we install this as part of project)
